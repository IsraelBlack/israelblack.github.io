      <h4>Solving a simple Problem</h4>
      <p>It can be disheartening to encounter a seemingly simple problem and it blocking you. Here's how you can over come: <br>
      While attempting to solve a problem where I had to make all of a sentence lower case so I could test it, I found difficulty
      in changing everything to lower case and then making 2 letters uppercase again (for the sentence). <br>
      To begin, I wrote a sentence on paper describing what I wanted to do. Since I was tired, I couldn't think properly so I asked 
      for help in the discord and got directed to an exercise to help. <br>
      Throughout the whole process, I felt really frustrated because I knew I should have been able to solve it but I struggled for 
      quite some time.<br>
      What I learnt is that I should really have taken a step back and had a walk and a breather to calm down before going back 
      and trying again.
      </p>
      <h4>Elgantly solving a problem:</h4>
      <p> While trying to complete a problem where I had to add a new property to a group of objects in an array, I had to figure out 
        how to count to the right object and add the right name. I tried many different ways of doing it. <br>
        To solve it, I wrote some pseudo code so I knew what I needed it to do. Then I talked it through with someone and had a break.
        When I went back to the problem, I found it much easier to overcome it. I tried researching a method I thought would work and 
        used it to solve my problem <br>
        I wasn't as frustrated as I was before as I felt I had some leads and would figure this out. When I solved it, I was elated <br>
        I cemented the idea of taking breaks when I was getting frustrated and talking through my issue. The solution came a lot easier
      </p>
      <h4>Problem Solving techniques</h4>
      <p>
        I'm confident with a few problem solving techniques such as pseudo-code and Googling. These are my go-to when I first encounter 
        a problem. Trying things I'm fairly confident with but I need to have a decent idea of what I can do first. Anything that involves 
        talking it through or asking for help is something I struggle with as I don't want to feel silly or stupid. I'm not very good at relfecting 
        as it requires me to slow down which I am not good at
      </p>
      <h4>Asking for help</h4>
      <p>
        I am often reluctant to ask for help because I want to be able to solve a problem myself before talking to anyone. I often 
        feel like asking for help is admitting defeat (only for myself, I never judge others for getting help) and so I only do it 
        if I'm very stuck on a problem
