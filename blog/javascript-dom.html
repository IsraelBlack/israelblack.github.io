        JavaScript and The DOM
      </div>

      <h4>Js, HTML and CSS</h4>
      <p>Javascript is the brains behind HTML and CSS. It makes changes to the page like changing numbers or making buttons work</p>
      <h4>Control Flow and Loops</h4>
      <p>Control Flow acts like a routine for computer programs. Like a fitness routine, control flow tells the computer what order to do the actions in. Bench press 
        first, then squats, then sit ups. For loops tell the computer how many times it has to perform an action, 10 sets on the bench press 3 times.
      </p>
      <h4>The DOM</h4>
      <p>The DOM is simply the way that HTML is organized so that the computer can take, add and change parts of the page (rather than doing it manually).<br>
        It uses a tree structure to access different elements, each of which have a parent-child relationship. Think of a family tree where a container is the 
        parent of a sub-container is the parent of the paragraph in that container
      </p>
      <h4>Arrays vs Objects</h4>
      <p>To get data from an Array, you have to grab it based on where it is in the array. An object can have an element selected by calling the object.element</p>
      <h4>Functions</h4>
      <p>Functions are small chunks of code that can be used time and again instead of having to write code out each time you want to use them. You only have to write 
        the code once, then you just call the function when you want to use it
