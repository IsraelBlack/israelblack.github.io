      <h4>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h4>
      <ol>
        <li class="show-li">I've learnt how to better reflect on my experiences to improve my reaction to difficulties</li>
        <li class="show-li">I've learnt to not listen to my ego when I have doubts about my ability. Imposter syndrome occurs frequently,
          especially when I get stuck on a problem for awhile
        </li>
        <li class="show-li">Mindfulness in listening is really important to understand another person and feel understood. 
          It's something I will try to continue
        </li>
      </ol>
      
      <h4>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
      <ol>
        <li class="show-li">Values are vital as they change the way you approach all of your work. From the work choose to do
          to the way you approach it to the way you work in a team.
        </li>
        <li class="show-li">Empathy is important when thinking about work will be best for your client but also with how others
          may feel in your team. High empathy can affect your relationship with your team and your work
        </li>
        <li class="show-li">Self-awareness along with empathy affects the way in which you interact with others. Being aware of the
          way in which your actions affects other is key to forming healthy relationships, including with the world around you
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
      <p>The core learning has been really forward thinking and really great to see. Given how very few people even know about some 
        of the skills we have learnt, it's been amazing to see them given to us
      </p>

      <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
      <p> Interacting with other people was quite difficult because the mindful listening activities because of how carefully you
        must listen and pay attention (not easy for me)
      </p>

      <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing 
        on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h4>
      <p> People skills are more sought after than technical skills (to an extent) and are in high demand at the moment so for
        industry in particular, they are important. Overall, they are not taught enough in society and we has individuals and as a 
        society benefit from more people having people skills
      </p>

      <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? 
        Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? 
        Justify your answer.</h4>
      <p> Core skills are vital to us as human beings. It isn't a waste of time to learn them because they can teach us how to better 
        look after ourselves and to treat others well. As mentioned before, people skills are in high demand and having them makes it 
        much easier to get hired. I was once told "You can teach coding, you can't teach people skills". While it's not entirely true,
        they are harder to teach, especially in a work place
