        Neuroplasticity & Growth mindset

      <h4>What is Neuroplasticity?</h4>
      <p>Neuroplasticity refers to our brains ability to constantly adapt and change based on what input we give it </p>
      <h4>Further explanation:</h4>
      <p> If we practice the same thing over and over again, it can physically changes our brain. It strengthens the neurons in our brain
        and makes our brain better and better at the skills related to a task. <br>
        Take coding for example, practicing coding everyday won't only make better at coding but will make you better at problem solving
        and logical thinking as a whole. <br> Learning a human language will help with memory and can offset dementia because of the 
        effort spent memorizing. Neuroplasticity allows our brains to adapt and change, they are never static
      </p>
      <h4>How is it useful?</h4>
      <p>By knowing about Neuroplasticity, we can make better choices about what we do with our spare time and the way we approach hobbies
        because we can choose things that benefit all facetes of life. Playing chess can help to strengthen logical pathways as can any
          activity that requires logical thinking (like strategy games). When we can program, we can think about how to solve 
          problems and that can also have the same affect! Feed your brain healthy inputs for a healthy brain!
      </p>
      <h4>How can I improve?</h4>
      <ul class="definition-list">
        <li class="show-li"><b>Reprogram</b>The best way to get good at it is practice everyday. Reprogram you brain!</li>
        <br>
        <li class="show-li"><b>Think </b>Think about doing your activity often when you aren't doing, you'll get better!</li>
        <br>
        <li class="show-li"><b>Be consistant</b> Your brain expends energy when it thinks something is worth its time, consistently is key!</li>

        <h4>What is Growth Mindset?</h4>
      <p>It is a way of approaching life that sees every setback as a way of getting better</p>
      <h4>Further explanation:</h4>
      <p> A growth mindest persists that every road block you get given doing anything is a challenge to overcome for self-betterment
        and not a reason to give up. You maintain that just because you struggle with something, it doesn't mean you should doubt yoursel;
        you should push to improve your abilities. Skills improve over time
      </p>
      <h4>How is it useful?</h4>
      <p>By approaching life with a growth mindest, you are less likely to give up when you find difficulties. This leads you to 
        find ways to overcome the challenge and give yourself the chance to grow and become better. <br> Take learning a human language 
        for example. You have been learning German for 2 years, you can hold conversations about a few topics, watch some TV and read
        Young adult books, but you can't feel yourself improving, you plateaued. You could give up thinking you just can't get better 
        or you can find a different way to approach language learning. Change you habits and techniques to suit your level
