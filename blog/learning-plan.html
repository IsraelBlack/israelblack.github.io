      <h4>What is my learning plan? </h4>
      <ol class="definition-list">
        <li class="show-li"><b>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway? </b>My goal is to become a fullstack web developer 
          to make myself versatile as an employee and so I can build my own websites from the ground up</li>
        <br>
        <li class="show-li"><b>2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning </b>My biggest strengths related to this are my 
          work ethic and my interpersonal skills and my biggest weaknesses include being inattentive and being disorganized at times</li>
        <br>
        <li class="show-li"><b>3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? </b> 
          I would like to improve my ability to work in a close knit team and to focus on my organizational skills 
          (especially related to creating and following timelines). I’ve worked in teams both in education and professionally and 
          I would love to further develop interpersonal skills as it’s vital in teams</li>
        <br>
        <li class="show-li"><b>4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme </b>
          To deal with the immense workload, I’ve been building good habits which include meditation, exercise and eating well. 
          With my ADHD, I’m very good at dealing with stress but dealing with the ADHD is the difficult part. I’ve been building habits to navigate this difficulty. 
          Routine and the previously mentioned habits go along well to improve my concentration.<br>To deal with over-mounting stress, 
          I spend extra time in prayer and in meditation as well as 
          going on walks and listening to music/ podcasts</li>
        <br>
        <li class="show-li"><b>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way </b>
          With course related issues, I would prefer to talk with other students first and then go to my home group facilitator. 
          With programming related questions, I can get help from my Fiance and her sisters who are all programmers.</li>
        <br>
        <li class="show-li"><b>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team </b> I would expect the facilitator to act as a 
          guide and a point of contact as we go throughout the course. Someone who can clarify the conditions of assignment completion etc.</li>
        <br>
        <li class="show-li"><b>7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. </b> 
          The most important scheduled block for me is the midday prayer on a Friday which is 	required for Muslim men. 
          The difficulty of it will be figuring out how I’m going to get to the 	Mosque from the Devacademy building.</li>
