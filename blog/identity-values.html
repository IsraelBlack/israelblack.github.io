      <ol class="definition-list">
        <li class="show-li">1. When I was in highschool, I found a purse with hundreds of dollars in it and multiple gift cards. 
          I took it home and had my dad drive me to the police station to return it. Finding the owner was easy for the police because it had a 
          drivers license and school ID.</li>
        <br>
        <li class="show-li">2. I was going through a hard time, stressed and not having a way to unwind. 
          In this, I would use my faith to bolster myself and as a source of peace to help me get through</li>
        <br>
        <li class="show-li">3. All through my childhood, I would read history books and up until now, 
          I like looking into cultures and perspectives that you are usually presented in western education. 
          I prime example is currently, I’m wanting to look into the islamic golden age which granted us modern mathematics and the foundations for medicine.</li>
          <br>
        <li class="show-li">4. Everyday, I try to thank God for the good in my life. I thank God for where I am today and 
          the opportunities and ease (relatively) with which I live my life.</li>
          <br>
        <li class="show-li">5.  If my brother and dad were to get into an argument, I would wait until i can figure both people’s 
          position before I can hold an opinion on right or wrong. I try to apply this to everything I hear.</li>

      <ol class="definition-list">
        <li class="show-li">I am proud for making it through university while working 4+ hours every day It was a lot of difficulty but I made it

      <h5 class="blog-text">Narrative of Values</h5>
    <ol class="definition-list">
      <li class="show-li">Growing up, my mum was always very kind and even handed, listening to both me and my brother if we had a fight and 
        punishing us fairly depending on who instigated and who escalated. She would always try her hardest to manage us and my 3 younger 
        siblings practically has a single mum because her partner (not my dad) was always working or going out with his mates. 
        This example of fairness and empathy is what led me to understanding it today.</li>
      <br>
      <li class="show-li">My father looked after me from the age of 14 to the age of 18. Those 4 years are some of the most important in 
        someones life and from him I learnt to really embrace my love for learning (it had always been present but he taught me to 
        really pursue any topic I wanted to learn about). 
        He taught me and made me curious about the fundamentals of philosophy which led me to learn how to self-examine 
        and to know what your morals are and to learn to apply them. He taught me to question</li>
      <br>
      <li class="show-li">One of my favorite quotes “The unexamined life is not worth living” -Socrates (not usually one for quoting Socrates I love this quote). 
        To me, it encourages constant reflection and striving for improvement.</li>

          <h5 class="blog-text">My Review of Learning</h5>
        <ol class="definition-list">
          <li class="show-li"><b>Position: Relative.</b>Reflecting on this first week: It’s been a good warm up I think, 
            a chance to establish habits and get an idea of how this course will work. I was way to relaxed with learning this week 
            and I’m going to need to step it up going forward to make sure I get  all the work finished.</li>
